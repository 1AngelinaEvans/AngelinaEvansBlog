# Creating Geographic Visualizations of House Quality

## Intro

In this guide, I will be sharing the steps I took to create geographic visualizations in Tableau related to housing quality. To demonstrate the process, I will be using data from the city of Ogden, Iowa. AI Housing team member Gavin created a [guide on evaluating cities](https://gavinfishy.github.io/Gavin_DSPG_Blog/posts/Gavin-Fisher_guide_w7/full_guide.html) using Ogden as an example. In hopes that the data will appear familiar, I will be using the resulting data from his city evaluation guide.

## Collecting Addresses from City

Steps for address collection and dataset cleaning are shown in the [address collection and cleaning section](https://gavinfishy.github.io/Gavin_DSPG_Blog/posts/Gavin-Fisher_guide_w7/full_guide.html#address-collection-and-cleaning) of Gavin's guide. It is **very important** that you have these things available in the dataset:

-   House number

-   Street name

-   City

-   State

-   Quality of house characteristics you wish to use in your geographic visualizations (ex. AI outputs for siding, vegetation, gutter).

    If you followed the steps in the address collection and cleaning section of Gavin's guide, your dataset might have some columns that look like this:

I suggest creating a new column that has combines contents from address, city, and state. I auto-populated the city column with the city name (Ogden) and the state column with the state name (Iowa). In a new column and new empty cell, I used the & to combine the contents of three columns. My function is:

**=Cell&","&Cell&","Cell**

=A2&","&B2&","&C2

Then I auto-populated the rest of the cells to utilize the same function.

## Geocoding Addresses in R

Using the addresses provided from the dataset, I acquired coordinates that can be used to map the address locations. There are several ways to geocode addresses. If you are familiar with ArcGIS or QGIS, you can use that but I had **major** issues with QGIS geocoding. I used the MMQGIS plugin and had multiple problems. First, it continued to crash and second, I could never successfully geocode all the addresses I needed to. Many of my addresses were missing and other team members had the same issue when using MMQGIS. So I would advise against starting with QGIS, unless it has worked well for you in the past.

You can also use python or R. I geocoded addresses in RStudio. I followed the approach provided by [StoryBench](https://www.storybench.org/geocode-csv-addresses-r/). I made a few changes to the code from StoryBench. The code and steps are shown below.

1.  Start by installing the ggmap package.

2.  Load in the csv file (Ogden database).

3.  Create data frames.

4.  Register a Google API key. Put the key in the "key goes here" spot.

5.  For loop: for each address, you receive a latitude and longitude. They should go in their respected columns (lat and long). Line 25 has the column name full_address. Change this to the name of the column that has your full addresses.

6.  Write the contents of origAddress to a new file (in this case, ogden_geocoded2.csv). Save the new file.

Once you have geocoded the addresses, you should have the latitude and longitude columns filled. Remove the NAs from the other columns.

## Mapping addresses from csv file using Tableau

There are many different ways you can map these addresses. If you have access to ArcGIS pro, you can use that. I also like using QGIS, an open source software. In this guide I will be using Tableau because this is what I used for my final visualizations. We decided to use Tableau because we needed to create other visualizations (ex. graphs) with the data provided in the csv file.

### 1. Register and download Tableau

As a student, you can register to get [Tableau Desktop free for one year.](https://www.tableau.com/academic/students) I was having installation issues, so I use [Tableau Public, which is free to anyone.](https://public.tableau.com/app/discover) You can use either for these visualizations, but my steps will be for Tableau Public. The desktop version is very similar so you should be able to follow along if using Tableau Desktop.

### 2. Create a new workbook and upload new data

Once you click "Create", you should be prompted to upload data from your computer. Select the csv file you wish to use. I am using ogden_database.csv.
