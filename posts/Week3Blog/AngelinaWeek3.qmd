# Week 3

This week was all about getting a better idea of the project's direction and learning about ways to accomplish our project goals.

## Web Scraping

One idea for the project is that we can web scrape from housing assessor websites such as [Iowa Assessors](https://iowaassessors.com/) and [Trulia](https://www.trulia.com/). If we are able to successfully do so, we can use images of houses and other information to train our AI model. I focused on learning more about web scraping using R through the DataCamp Course called Web Scraping in R. Before that I also worked on the Intermediate R course to better understand what can be done with R. I have been trying to understand the web scraping process using DataCamp and other online tutorials.

We are also trying to gather images of houses and other data using a google API.

## Artificial Intelligence

Something that has been interesting this week is learning how we can use AI to help with our project. I am learning more about AI through the videos: [Getting Started with Python Deep Learning for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19LQRx78QVU&list=PLgNJO2hghbmiXg5d4X8DURJP9yv9pgjIu&index=2) and [Build a Deep CNN Image Classifier with ANY Images](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jztwpsIzEGc), and Gavin's explaining.

## Things That are Going Well

One of my hopes from week 2 was that I would get better with editing and updating blogs. Now I feel a bit more comfortable with the blogs and things are working better for me.

I also think that my group has a good idea of what we should get done. We were also able to come up with steps (ex. creating trials for our AI model that would be easier to troubleshoot).

## Things to Work On

I definitely want to make more progress with web scraping because that is a key part of the project.
