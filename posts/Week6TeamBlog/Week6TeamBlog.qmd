# Housing Team Week 6 Wrap-Up

## WinVEST Project

On Monday and Tuesday of week six, the DSPG team traveled to Grundy Center, New Hampton and Independence, Iowa. In groups of 3-4 people, we walked around residential areas and observed the condition of houses and lots. The Fulcrum app was used to record observations. We assigned good, fair and poor ratings to attributes such as:

-   Roof

-   Gutter

-   Landscape

-   Siding

-   Sidewalk to the house

    We also noted whether there was junk or obstructions on the property and took photos of the houses.

While in residential neighborhoods, we also gave general impressions of blocks by observing presence and quality of:

-   Neighborhood sidewalks

-   Street lights

-   Way-finding signs

-   Storm drainage systems

-   Curb cuts

-   Street trees

## Demographic Profiles

One of the goals of the project has been to provide demographic profiles of the three cities focused on for the WinVEST project : Independence, New Hampton and Grundy Center. We want to show characteristics related to income and population, and how these characteristics have been changing through the years or how they are expected to change in the future. Several graphs were made in R to show these three cities' economic and population backgrounds.

## Mapping

To visualize addresses for the WinVEST cities and Slater, first we need to geocode them (get a latitude and longitude for each address). This was done using R. Base code was from [storybench](https://www.storybench.org/geocode-csv-addresses-r/).

```{r eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}

# Geocoding a csv column of "addresses" in R
install.packages("ggmap")
#load ggmap
install.packages("ggplot2")
library(ggmap)

dir.create("geocoded")

# Select the file from the file chooser
fileToLoad <- file.choose(new = TRUE)

# Read in the CSV data and store it in a variable 
origAddress <- read.csv(fileToLoad, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Initialize the data frame
geocoded <- data.frame(stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# API Key here, TAKE OUT WHEN PUSHING TO GITHUB---DO NOT SHARE KEY
register_google(key = "key goes here")

# Loop through the addresses to get the latitude and longitude of each address and add it to the
# origAddress data frame in new columns lat and lon
for(i in 1:nrow(origAddress))
{
  # Print("Working...")
  result <- geocode(origAddress$Full_Address[i], output = "latlon", source = "google")
  origAddress$lon[i] <- as.numeric(result[1])
  origAddress$lat[i] <- as.numeric(result[2])
  #origAddress$geoAddress[i] <- as.character(result[3])
}

folder <- "folder path goes here"
file <- "geocoded_all_cities.csv"

# Write a CSV file containing origAddress to the working directory
write.csv(origAddress, file.path(folder, file), row.names=FALSE)
```

Addresses are plotted in QGIS using the coordinates. There are some addresses that are not in the correct place. For example, there is a point in Marion, which is in Linn County. This point is supposed to be located in Independence, IA. This is something to look into next week.

#### Preparing to map AI-based data

With the coordinates for Slater and a new field with "Good", "Fair", and "Poor" assigned randomly to each address, a sample map was created in which gutter quality for houses in the city are shown. In time, we hope to use maps to display well-trained AI model ratings for landscapes, siding, gutters etc. This will allow us and our clients to visualize where better quality homes are vs lower quality.
