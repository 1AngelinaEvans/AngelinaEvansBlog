# Housing Team Week 3 Wrap-Up

## Project Progress

This week, our team was able to spend time thinking and talking about:

-   Our takeaways from last week's client meeting

-   Project goals

-   Methods to use when working to reach project goals

-   New ideas to add into our project

### DataCamp Courses Completed

-   Web Scraping in R

-   Intermediate R

### Web Scraping

We currently have ideas to scrape from housing assessor websites such as [Iowa Assessors](https://iowaassessors.com/) and [Trulia](https://www.trulia.com/). If we are able to successfully do so, images of houses and other information can be utilized to train our AI model(s).

Kailyn and I focused on learning more about web scraping using R through the DataCamp Course called *Web Scraping in R*. We also began to follow steps for scraping the web using other tutorials.

The housing team also hopes to gather images of houses and other data using a Google API.

### AI Modeling: Vegetation Model

To get an idea of how to use AI for the project, a sample model was trained to determine if a house has vegetation or no vegetation. About 750 images in total were used to train, validate and test the model.

The model was successfully trained and process did not take long.

## Things That Went Well This Week

-   Creation of AI model was quicker than anticipated. We can focus more time into other aspects of the project (ex. data collection)

-   Kailyn was able to set up her blog!

-   We now have a better idea of the project's methods and goals.

## Things that Did Not Go Well

-   Learning to web scrape has been a bit challenging. We need to understand more than what the DataCamp course shared.

## Some Plans for Next Week

-   Get a rough database running with housing info. We may be able to utilize a web interface that will allow us to more efficiently get data.

-   Familiarize ourselves with web scraping.

-   Meet with client(s) to show the project's progress.

-   Scrape data from Iowa Accessors site for Independence, Slater, New Hampton, Grundy Center, or other cities.Â
