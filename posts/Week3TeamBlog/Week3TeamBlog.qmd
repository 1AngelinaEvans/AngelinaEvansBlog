\## Project Progress

This week, our group was able to time thinking and talking about:

\- Project goals

\- Methods to use when working to reach project goals

\- Ways to work together on parts of the project

\- New ideas to add into our project

\- Recurring concerns

Our group began to come up with a plan to use AI models as well as data we get from the housing assessor websites and Google API to rate houses.
