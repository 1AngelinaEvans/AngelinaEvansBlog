# Week 5

## Sorting Houses

I am sorting images for the AI model that is used to determine if there is one house in the image or multiple. I sort the images into folders: one for images with one house, another for images with multiple houses. If there is not a house present, or if a building in the image is not a house, these images go in their own folders as well.
