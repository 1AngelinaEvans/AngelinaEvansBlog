# Week 5

Preparing images for AI model training, training an AI model, and getting refreshed on mapping spatial data in R were my main focuses of week 5.

## Sorting Houses

This week I worked on sorting images for the AI model that is used to determine if there is one house in the image or multiple. I sort the images into folders: one for images with one house, another for images with multiple houses. If there is not a house present, or if a building in the image is not a house, these images go in their own folders as well.

![This is not a house.](G_S_308%20MAIN%20ST_.png){fig-align="center" width="332"}

There were many duplicate images in the photos, where pictures of were taken of the same house. I did my best to remove duplicate photos. There were also many files that produced errors and an image of the house was not able to appear. I made sure to remove those as well so the AI does not consider these images in the training.

## AI Model: Multiple Houses

After I sorted all the Google images for the city of Slater, I am able to train the model that will be used to determine if there is one house in the photo or multiple houses. Below are screenshots of the code used to build the model.

## Geographic Visualizations

For the AI Housing project, we need to create some data visualizations that can help us and clients/users to better understand the project and the cities that may benefit from the project. To create maps in R, I need to refresh myself on mapping spatial data in R. I am doing the course called *Visualizing Geospatial Data in R*. I am also reading Chapter 5 Kyle Walker's Tidy Census Book. The chapter is [Census Geographic Data and Applications in R](https://walker-data.com/census-r/census-geographic-data-and-applications-in-r.html).

#### *Geocoding Problems*

I would like to geocode addresses for this project. I have 6,224 addresses that belong to the four Winvest cities: Slater, New Hampton, Grundy Center, Independence. I want to geocode and plot the addresses using QGIS. I used Google API key to geocode all the addresses. But I am only getting 953/6224 results. Right now I have coordinates for about 607 Slater addresses (all Slater addresses) and the other 300 something are for *some* of New Hampton\'s addresses. QGIS creates an output file of all results where the address was not found.  When I open this output file, it is just blank.

I have also tried geocoding and plotting only 100 addresses as a sample. It was able to geocode 92/100 addresses. But I was not able to see which ones failed and why. The output file of failed addresses was also blank. I am using MMQGIS. When I try to geocode, MMQGIS crashes but I am able to get output files. I updated MMQGIS but the same thing is happening.
