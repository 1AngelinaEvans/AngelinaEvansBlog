    "text": "My first week with DSPG\nDuring week one, I took a couple data camp courses to get more familiar with topics in R, Github, and web scraping in R.\nHere is an example of what I did in the Intro to R course. In the code below, there are two vectors: scores and comments.\n\nscores <- c(4.6, 5, 4.8, 5, 4.2)\ncomments <- c(\"I would watch it again\", \"Amazing!\", \"I liked it\", \"One of the best movies\", \"Fascinating plot\")\n\nI can get the mean of the scores vector by writing:\n\nmean(scores)\n\n[1] 4.72\n\n\nSomething that was very new to me in R was matrices. I learned how to create them and how to reference specific rows and columns.\n\n# Vector with numerics from 1 up to 10\nmy_vector <- 1:10 \n\n# Matrix with numerics from 1 up to 9\nmy_matrix <- matrix(1:9, ncol = 3)\n\n# First 10 elements of the built-in data frame mtcars\nmy_df <- mtcars[1:10,]\n\n# Construct list with these different elements:\nmy_list <- list(my_vector,my_matrix,my_df)"
